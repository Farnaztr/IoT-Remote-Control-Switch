## 🧠 Introduction

Have you ever wished you could control your home lights or appliances remotely, using just your smartphone, without needing any intermediate device like a dedicated hub or a computer always running? The **IoT Remote Control Switch** project does exactly that!

By leveraging a NodeMCU (ESP8266) board and a relay module, you can easily transform any 220V electrical appliance into a smart device, controllable via a simple web page in your phone's browser. This project operates completely autonomously — once programmed, it requires no further connection to a laptop or PC.

This project is perfect for beginners in IoT and home automation, offering a practical and rewarding experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Wireless Control:** Turn your electrical appliances ON/OFF over Wi-Fi.
- **Standalone Operation:** No need for a laptop or intermediary server after initial programming.
- **Simple Web Interface:** Minimalist and user-friendly interface accessible via any smartphone browser.
- **Cost-Effective:** Utilizes affordable and readily available electronic components.
- **Scalable:** Provides a solid foundation for more complex IoT projects.
- **Basic Security:** Avoids exposing sensitive Wi-Fi credentials in public code.
- **Cross-Platform Access:** Control from any device (phone, tablet, PC) on the same Wi-Fi network.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project uses a **NodeMCU ESP8266** board configured as a mini web server:

1. **Wi-Fi Connection:** On power-up, the NodeMCU connects to your home Wi-Fi network using stored credentials.
2. **Internal Web Server:** The board runs a small embedded HTTP server.
3. **Control Page:** When you enter the NodeMCU's IP in your browser, it serves a control page.
4. **HTTP Commands:** ON/OFF buttons send HTTP GET requests to the board.
5. **GPIO Control:** The board sets the designated GPIO pin to HIGH or LOW based on request.
6. **Relay Activation:** Relay switches the connected 220V appliance accordingly.

## 🔌 Wiring Diagram

**Low Voltage: NodeMCU → Relay Module**

- `VIN` → `VCC`
- `GND` → `GND`
- `D8 (GPIO15)` → `IN` *(RELAY_PIN)*

**High Voltage: Relay Module → 220V Appliance**

- Cut the **Live (L)** wire from the wall outlet.
  - One end → `COM` on Relay
  - Other end → `NO` (Normally Open) on Relay
- **Neutral (N)** goes directly from wall to appliance.

> ⚠️ **Safety First:** Always disconnect power before wiring. If unsure, ask an electrician!

## 💻 Software Setup

### 1. Preparing the Arduino IDE

Install the ESP8266 Board Support:

- Open **Arduino IDE** → File → Preferences  
- In *Additional Board URLs* paste:

http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json


- Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "`esp8266`" → Install **ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community**

Required Libraries (auto-installed with board package):

- `ESP8266WiFi.h`
- `ESP8266WebServer.h`

---

### 2. Uploading the Code

1. Open your `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
2. Replace Wi-Fi credentials:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
